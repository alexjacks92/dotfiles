Configuration files for my *nix systems. All of it is for running Linux systems - much of it, ie vimrc/tmux/zshrc, 
can be used on OSX systems or in Cygwin for Windows.

usage: mkdir ~/Repos, clone this to ~/Repos/dotfiles, cd ~ and run:

sudo sh Repos/dotfiles/install/install.sh "youremailhere"

RUN AS SUDO. If you don't, you'll constantly be bothered to confirm choices, ie whether or not to install each package.
